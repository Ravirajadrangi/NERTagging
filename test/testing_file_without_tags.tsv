there
was
a
high

This

offers
several
unique
advantages
,
including
high
specific
activity
,
high
binding
affinity
,
and
low

,
all
of
which
make
it
an
excellent
probe
for
the

;
however
,
a

relative

gives
rise
to
only
weakly

Also
effective
are

and
mixed

The

and
even
better
on

similar

Overall
comparison
of
the
results
indicate
that

is
subject

suggests
that

A

substituted

carboxylic
acids
were
prepared
as
excitatory
amino

receptor

.
Preliminary
evidence
suggests
that
2b
is
a
storage
analogue
of
norepinephrine
.
The
results
allow
the
establishment
of
a
three

pharmacophore
of
the
glycine
receptor
antagonist
site
,
incorporating
a
newly
defined
bulk

The

for

greater
than
those
observed
for

(

and

,
while
the
binding
affinity
for

was
found
to
be
100

those
of

The

However
,
the

Where
